# Analysis of Olympic Success Impact on Sports Valuation and Popularity

Welcome to my analysis on the potential impact of Olympic success on the valuation and popularity of particular sports in a country. In this project, I explored datasets on Forbes athlete pay, sports enrollment popularity, and Olympic medals to investigate whether Olympic success correlates with increased popularity and valuation of sports.

## Motivation

As a developing analyst, I was intrigued by the relationship between athletic achievements at the Olympic Games and the subsequent valuation and popularity of sports in a country. This analysis allowed me to apply my Python skills to merge and analyze large and complex datasets in pursuit of meaningful insights.

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection:** I gathered datasets from various sources, including Forbes athlete pay rankings, sports enrollment statistics, and Olympic medal tallies.

2. **Data Merging:** Using Python, I merged the datasets based on relevant criteria such as country, sport, and time period.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** I conducted exploratory data analysis to identify trends and patterns in the data. This involved visualizing the data, calculating summary statistics, and performing hypothesis testing where applicable.

4. **Statistical Analysis:** I utilized statistical techniques to quantify the relationship between Olympic success and sports valuation/popularity. This included correlation analysis, regression modeling, and hypothesis testing to determine the significance of any observed relationships.

## Findings

After thorough analysis, I found that there was a limited effect of Olympic success on both the valuation and popularity of particular sports in a country. While there were instances of correlations between Olympic medal counts and certain metrics such as athlete pay or sports enrollment, the relationships were generally weak or inconclusive.

## Conclusion

This analysis serves as one of my first exploratory pieces done in Python and showcases my ability to merge and analyze large and complex datasets to discover noteworthy trends. Despite the limited effect observed on sports valuation and popularity, this project provided valuable insights into the dynamics between Olympic success and its broader impact on sports culture. Moving forward, I aim to continue refining my data analysis skills and exploring new avenues for uncovering actionable insights from data.
